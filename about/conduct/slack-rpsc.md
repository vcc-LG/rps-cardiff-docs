# The Use of Slack in RPS Cardiff


# Introduction
Slack is a popular team messaging application that RPS Cardiff team members use to improve efficiency, productivity, and to help our team to share ideas. 

This document describes how we use it, and the rules governing its use.

Slack groups are called 'teams'. Each team has several 'channels', which are separate chat areas themed around a particular topic (e.g. '#announcements, #general). Users can talk to the entire team, specific members of a team, or just a single member in direct messages. 

## Installation

Slack can be run within a browser (IE, Chrome etc.), in a desktop application, or on your mobile (iOs/Android). You will receive an email invitation to your NHS email address which lets you create a username and join teams and channels. You can turn Slack's notifications to your preferred settings.

## Common ways to use Slack

Slack should be used for work-based communication where an instant response is desirable, or just to share a message with the whole team at once without having to draft an email in Outlook. For instance, you could:

- Ask the LPA a question in the #lasers channel.
- Announce to the team that you're running late to a meeting.
- Inform a team member working offsite that they left some kit behind.
- Note down an idea for a presentation to gauge interest in a collaboration.
- Search the #car channel to see who 
- Thank a team member for their hard work during the day.

Try to keep conversations centered around work, and use the most appropriate channel for communication (e.g. announce a meeting in the #meetings or #announcements channel, rather than the #general channel).

## What Slack shouldn't be used for

Slack is a work-based communication tool, and so the standards expected of you in work with regards to conduct and the sharing of information applies equally in the Slack environment. Whilst the tone of Slack messaging is usually relaxed and conversational, and the service is secure to the same extent as most forms of instant messaging, it should be viewed as an essentially public forum rather than as an extension of your Outlook. Never use Slack to:

- Share or discuss patient identifiable information, confidential matters, or content that would violate any of the policies applicable to you as a member of Velindre NHS Trust staff.
- Abuse, exclude, or insult colleagues whether they can view the messages in which they're being discussed or not. The policies governing your behaviour in work apply equally in Slack.
- Discuss sensitive personal matters, or hold conversations that would be considered inappropriate at work.

## Expectations

There is no expectation on you to use Slack outside of standard working hours, and there is no expectation of you to use Slack when your full concentration is required for other work. Set your status to 'away' or 'do not disturb' whenever you wish.

Try to respond to messages that involve you directly, and try to offer help to other users if you think you can. You are not expected to respond to messages immediately.

If the conversation would be easier to hold in real life, then pick up the phone or walk down the corridor. Like email, Slack isn't a replacement for face-to-face communication.

Communicate clearly and concisely. Use friendly, open, and inclusive language and be constructive. Always assume that messages from others are sent with the best intentions.

If Slack isn't improving the quality of your output, talk to another team member for advice about different ways of using it. If it still isn't working for you, uninstall it and inform others that you're accessible by other means.
