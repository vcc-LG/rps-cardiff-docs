# The Use of Slack in RPS Cardiff

# Introduction
Slack is a popular team messaging application that RPS Cardiff use to improve efficiency, productivity, and to help our team to share ideas. 

This document describes how we use it, and the rules governing its use.

Slack groups are called 'teams'. Each team has several 'channels', which are separate chat areas themed around a particular topic (e.g. '#announcements, #general). Users can talk to the entire team, specific members of a team, or just a single member in direct messages. 

## Installation

Slack can be run within a browser (IE, Chrome etc.), in a desktop application, or on your mobile (iOs/Android). You will receive an email invitation to your NHS email address which lets you create a username and join teams and channels. You can turn Slack's notifications to your preferred settings.

## Common ways to use Slack

Slack should be used for work-based communication where an instant response is desirable, or just to share a message with the whole team at once without having to draft an email in Outlook. For instance, you could:

- Ask the LPA a question in the #lasers channel.
- Announce to the team that you're running late to a meeting.
- Inform a team member working offsite that they left some kit behind.
- Note down an idea for a presentation to gauge interest in a collaboration.
